# Coursera_Capstone
Capstone project for the applied data science course. Using demographic data from the city of Toronto I asked the question where would be the best location to open a Mediterranean cuisine restaurant. Using four square api to determine current Mediterranean restaurant locations as well as the demographics where Mediterranean people live in the city, I used clustering techniques to finde the ideal neighbourhood for a new Mediterranean restaurant
